# Python TLS/SSL Implementation Demo

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of TLS/SSL using Python. It includes a certificate manager, a TLS server, a TLS client, and encryption demonstrations. The project is designed for educational purposes to showcase how TLS works and how to implement it in Python.

## Features

- **Certificate Management**: Generate and manage self-signed TLS certificates.
- **TLS Server**: Set up a secure server that can accept TLS connections.
- **TLS Client**: Connect to the TLS server and send/receive messages securely.
- **Encryption Demonstration**: Showcase encryption algorithms like AES-GCM and RSA.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Interactive menu for users to navigate through functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-tls-demo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate Certificates**:
   Run the application and select the option to generate certificates.

4. **Run the Demo**:
   Execute the demo script:
   ```
   python run_demo.py
   ```

## Usage

- Start the server by selecting the appropriate option in the menu.
- Connect to the server using the client and send messages.
- Explore the encryption demo to see how different algorithms work.
